## Codebase Patterns
- Position status values: 'not_visited' | 'in_progress' | 'skipped' | 'correct'
- Use gameStore selectors for computed state (hasVisitedAllPositions, hasSkippedPositions, findNextUnfinished)
- Zustand partialize controls what persists to localStorage

## 2026-01-25 - US-001: Add hasSkippedPositions selector to game store
- Already implemented in packages/frontend/src/stores/gameStore.ts (lines 508-517)
- Selector iterates through positionStates and returns true if any status === 'skipped'
- Interface defined at line 126, implementation at lines 508-517
- Files: packages/frontend/src/stores/gameStore.ts (no changes needed)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Selector pattern: iterate totalScreenshots from 1 to N, check positionStates[i]
  - hasVisitedAllPositions and hasSkippedPositions are both declared in interface and implemented
---

## 2026-01-25 - US-002: Add showCompletionChoice state to game store
- Added showCompletionChoice boolean to GameState interface
- Added setShowCompletionChoice(value: boolean) action
- Added to initialState with default false
- State NOT in partialize, so NOT persisted to localStorage
- Resets to false when resetGame() is called (spreads initialState)
- Files changed: packages/frontend/src/stores/gameStore.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - To prevent persistence, simply don't include in partialize object
  - resetGame spreads initialState, so new state fields auto-reset
---

## 2026-01-25 - US-003: Add findFirstSkipped selector to game store
- Added findFirstSkipped() selector that returns first skipped position number or null
- Iterates 1 to totalScreenshots, returns first i where positionStates[i].status === 'skipped'
- Files changed: packages/frontend/src/stores/gameStore.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Similar pattern to hasSkippedPositions but returns position number instead of boolean
